# Stopwatch

This is a simple, responsive stopwatch application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, created using the guide provided by [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech/courses/stopwatch__htmlcssjs_project). It allows users to easily start, stop, and reset time and features a clean and minimal user interface.

## Features
